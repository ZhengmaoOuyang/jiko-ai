### Credits
The audio processing of this project relies heavily on [IBM's Speech-To-Text Service](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/marketplace/speech-to-text), and a majority of the game code was written using the pygame library (see Dependencies/Imports). 

Other sites that were integral to the building of the project include:

### Dependencies/Imports
* [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) - for building multimedia applications like games
* [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) - an imaging library
* [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) - for being able to make API calls to IBM Watson
* json - part of the standard Python library for dealing with this format
* [pyaudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/) - for handling audio I/O
